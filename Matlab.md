## To Matlab from Python

- Iterates starting from 1 instead of 0
- Must use `clc;clear all; close all;clear variables` in the editor to ensure that all command variables & figures are closed before rerunning script.
- EOL(End of Lines) must end with `;`
- `hold on` must be added after figure numbers are instantiated in order to continue plotting on the same figure.
