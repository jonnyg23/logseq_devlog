# Hazard Communication Quiz


## Notes

### Purpose

- Regarding the save use and handling of hazardous chemicals to which people are exposed to.

### Policy

- Chemical Storage
	- Storage areas must be well **illuminated** and well **ventilated** with exhaust air leaving the building.
	- Lab fume hoods must **not** be used for chemical storage.

- Flammables
	- Flammable liquids in large quantities (over 4 liters) should be kept in UL or FM approved safety cans with flash arresters. **This includes portable gasoline containers.**
	- To prevent static electricity discharge, bulk containers **MUST** be grounded. 

- Oxidizers
	- Examples of oxidizers include many acids (e.g. nitric, perchloric, sulfuric), hydrogen peroxide chlorine, fluorine, nitrous oxide, and compressed oxygen.
	- **No container should be handled if there is suspicion of peroxide contamination. Immediately contact the Safety Officer in such circumstances.**

- Compressed Gases
	- Special Note:
		- **Compressed oxygen cylinders that are in storage must be stored at least 20 feet from compressed fuel gas cylinders and flammables (especially oil and grease) or must be physically separated by a 5' non-combustible barrier.**

- Waste Chemical Storage
	- The containers themselves must be compatible and sturdy. **For large volumes, glass bottles or jars are inappropriate waste containers because of the potential for breakage.**
	- For large quantities of hazardous waste, a secondary containment berm or tray in the storage area is necessary to provide containment in the event of leakage or spills. The containment should be capable of holding 10-15% of the waste's volume.

- Disposal
	- **Chemical waste or contaminated samples must not be disposed of in solid waste dumpsters or via the sanitary sewer unless specific approval has been received from all governing state and local regulatory agencies.**

- Transport
	- No employee shall transport hazardous wastes over the road. 
	- Quantities of chemical products needed to conduct routine operations such as gasoline, acetone, methanol, etc. may be transported as long as the following conditions are met.
		- Containers must be labeled as per requirements
		- Gas must be transported in UL or FM approved safety cans with flash arresters.
		- Chem. containers must be air-tight in non-breakable enclosures.
		- Large tanks (e.g. over 1001 lbs. or 100 gals.) for gas, diesel fuel or other flammables must be mounted and placarded with the appropriate DOT placard info and #.
		- Safety Data sheet for chemicals must be transported in the vehicle.

- Labels & other forms of warnings shall contain:
	- The identity of the hazardous chemical(s)
	- Appropriate hazard warnings
	- Name and address of the chemical manufacturer, importer, or other responsible party

- Safety Data Sheets (SDS)
	- A master set of SDS is in the office.
	- The copies include the following:
		- Identification
		- Hazard(s) Identification
		- Composition/information on ingredients
		- First-aid measures
		- Fire-fighting measures
		- Accidental release measures Handling and storage
		- Exposure controls/personal protection
		- Physical and chemical properties
		- Stability and reactivity
		- Toxicological information
		- Ecological information
		- Disposal considerations
		- Transport information
		- Regulatory information
		- Other information

- Non-Routine Tasks
	- Due to the varied workplaces employees may occupy, there is a potential of encountering unlabeled pipes which may contain hazardous chemicals. As a precaution, employees will consider **all unlabeled pipes to contain hazardous chemicals**.
