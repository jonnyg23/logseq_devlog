kanban-plugin: basic

## TODO 💭



## DOING ⚙️

- [ ] Questions: 1. Do we use the `constraints` in `SectionIntent` for the min_thickness? Or should I add a separate function for this? **Note:** I cannot add them where they are specified in `compute.py` because the each section is an immutable tuple.


## Done

- [ ] Add loading progress bar on top of page when going to different page routes.
