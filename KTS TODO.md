kanban-plugin: basic

## TODO 💭

- [ ] Added Hamburger Menu with Reallocated Buttons.
- [ ] 1. Need to Check on how to add the :loading prop to each list item once clicked.
- [ ] 2. Need to make dialog box appear when clicking "Show Usages" and perform the logic on the intersection of current part being observed with towers it is being used in. Make "Delete" or "Show Usages" disabled depending on computed results. We may have to perform this logic in the "computed" section of the vue file.


## DOING ⚙️

- [ ] Refactor Linking Feature to its own Component - Just need to refactor into separate component.


## IN REVIEW 🔍



## REPORT 📎

- [ ] Working on creating links for each tower attribute for shortcuts to where they are defined.
