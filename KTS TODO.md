## TODO 💭

- [ ] Add Hamburger Menu with Reallocated Buttons.
- [ ] 1. Need to Check on how to add the :loading prop to each list item once clicked.
- [ ] 2. Add "Show Usages" Button with a badge that shows how many references to towers the current turbine, design basis, inventory, materials, & bolts has with towers.
- [ ] 3. Add the meta-data feature that is within the "Delete" request in main.py to the "Get" request section. This will be used to perform Step 2 above by getting references for each tower using the object.
