## TODO üí≠

- [ ] Add Hamburger Menu with Reallocated Buttons.
- [ ] 1. Need to Check on how to add the :loading prop to each list item once clicked.
- [ ] Add loading progress bar on top of page when going to different page routes.
- [ ] Question: **Materials & Bolts don't have tower refs even though they should?** ==This is a separate task==
- [ ] **Bug**: Tower Intent Sketch only shows after pressing the back button and selecting "no" on leaving the tower with unsaved changes. (Unless the sketch takes longer to load? but it shouldn't since it is being read from dynamoDB)


## DOING ‚öôÔ∏è

- [ ] Speed up tower list page task <br>1. Add crud rules for adding projection information to top level of db response. <br>2. metadata: sections (data.sections), hub_height (data.hub_height) , turbine uuid (data.turbine), pure boto3 command-line no python. <br> 3. On terraform end: Global secondary index
- [ ] Changing annotations for better visibility on blueprint pdfs and tower sketches.


## IN REVIEW üîç

- [ ] Remove white space in Design Basis Analyzers; Add elevation to each card to distinguish them from one another
- [ ] **T31** Add thickness of trap at bottom of each section to output.


## REPORT üìé

- [ ] Working on creating links for each tower attribute for shortcuts to where they are defined.
- [ ] Added Website Shortcut Icon
- [ ] Fixed local docker setup & was able to run it. The fix was **running the makefile commands in a git bash terminal window rather than a powershell window** Also, Gage helped me authenticate into the towerdesign library.
- [ ] Refactor Linking Feature to its own Component - Just need to refactor into separate component. **Reviewed: Update LibrarySelect so we don't need turbine-select. Also add a mixin for the routeTo. Call this mixin "routeToLibrary". Then remove routeTo from methods & chips.**
- [ ] Change color of Usage button
- [ ] 2. Add "Show Usages" Button with a badge that shows how many references to towers the current turbine, design basis, inventory, materials, & bolts has with towers.
- [ ] Only show unarchived towers.
- [ ] Make buttons disabled in CRUDView.vue until data from tower usage has been loaded.
