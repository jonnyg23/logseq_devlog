kanban-plugin: basic

---

## TODO 💭

- [ ] Add loading progress bar on top of page when going to different page routes.
- [ ] **Bug**: Tower Intent Sketch only shows after pressing the back button and selecting "no" on leaving the tower with unsaved changes. (Unless the sketch takes longer to load? but it shouldn't since it is being read from dynamoDB)


## DOING ⚙️

- [ ] Update to new tower list layout once gsi is updated for projected attrs such as rev and statuses.
