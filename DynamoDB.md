# [[DynamoDB]]

>DynamoDB is a [[NoSQL]] database.
---

## Info

- Since DynamoDB is not a SQL database, **it does not have foreign keys** like [[Postgres]].
- It is a NoSQL database that doesn't support relational data. There is no data integrity maintained between tables, so this sort of behavior is not built in. If you want to have this sort of behavior, you will have to model your data storage in DynamoDB a different way.
